# Web-App-with-Flask-Framework
Set up a development environment and create a responsive web application using flask framework


Flask is a commonly used microframework for developing web applications using the Python language. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. It is a lightweight framework that allows developers to create integrated applications quickly.

That's why some of the most popular sites and services have been built using Flask, such as Pinterest, Reddit and Lyft.

The framework provides ease of development in both frontend and backend endpoints into a single codebase, while allowing integration with a wide variety of Python packages and libraries to create complex applications.

In completing this campaign, players with some basic knowledge of web development will pick up the key aspects of Flask and add it to their repertoire in web development.
